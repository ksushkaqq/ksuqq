    <h3>Information about me.</h3>
    <p>
    	My name is Klimovich Ksenia. I am 17 years old. I was born and live in Penza. My parents sent me to school at the age of 7, and so did most of the children.
    	I graduated from 9th grade and my dream has always been to go to art college to become a choreographer. But fate had other plans for my life. I couldn't get into choreography and my choice fell on IT college. A couple of my friends also wanted to enter the IT field, so my choice of admission depended on the place where my friends would go, but even then there was a difficulty. My friend enrolled in the IT college of my friend in Penza State Technical University. Then, by random method, I got a chance to study at an IT college and I don't regret it a bit.

    	<h3>My hobbies and interests.</h3>
    	<p>
    		I've been dancing since I was 8 years old, it means a lot to me and I really like it. once I wanted to connect my life with this, but it didn't work out a bit, though... I can say that I had a good chance to combine work, hobbies and studies. This summer I got a chance to work as a coach, it doesn't take much effort and I really like doing it!
            Also, after completing the 3D modeling courses, I really liked working in a blender, 
            I can't say that this is my hobby, but sometimes I like to sit and make some funny characters, I like it.
